# ---- PROJECT DESCRIPTION ----
# CMD_CALENDAR is an attempt to make a calendar system with events and reminders on the command line. It is akin to a very-simplified Google Calendar, Windows Calendar, etc.
# FEATURES: 1. The calendar of any month or year can be displayed here (Gregorian only, infinitely extended in both directions).
#           2. Events can be added to any particular day. One can search for events and delete them.
# USAGE: Start main.py using python. At the calendar> prompt, enter the specific command to do whatever you wish to do. calendar> -h will provide help.
# PLANS: 1. Reminders for events through either email or desktop notifications are planned. 
#        2. A more colourful UI might be implemented.
# 
# WORKING: 1. Once main.py starts up, it shows the calendar for the current month and an input prompt.
#          2. The user enters a argument at the prompt. This is error-checked and parsed by parseCommand()
#          3. The parsed command is sent to execCommand(), which carries out the user's operation.
#             -> If command parsing fails, the error will be displayed, followed by the next prompt.
#             -> If the input is invalid, the error page is shown, followed by the next prompt.
#          4. Once the operation is done, the prompt is displayed again for the next command.
#          5. Steps 2-4 continue for ever until the user inputs "exit" or closes the program in some other fashion.

import calendar # In-built: Used for getting the calendars for any month or year.
import colorama # pip installed: Used for enabling ANSI sequences for cursor positioning and colours in Windows.
import argparse # In-built: Used for argument parsing.
import shlex # In-built: Extends argparse to strings which resemble arguments.
import pickle # In-built: Used to store the events dictionary offline.
import os # In-built: Used to get the CMD dimensions and clear the screen.
import datetime # In-built: Used for manipulating dates easily.
import numpy # pip installed: Used for reshaping an array in one place; it will be removed once a better way is found.
import time # In-built: Used for the sleep function; if you do not want the main page to be displayed, you can delete this.
